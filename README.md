# 3D Reconstruction Router

## To Do List
1 - Solve the problem of the height of the cylinder.  It must be located above the floor.

2 - The COPS was have some problem with the sizes of the subgroups, clusters and vertices, when the number of subgroups and vertices is big. We think that the problem is on RouteOptimization to form the subgroups.

3 - Solve the problem to get the reconstruction statistics from COLMAP. The script is freezing when the output is in file.

4 - Verify why the distance of the group is incorrect.
